The U.S. \nhas been the largest foreign direct investor in Singapore, with US$229 billion \nof investment. U.S. businesses bring with them unique expertise, an innovative \norientation,  and  new  technologies  that  contribute  to  the  vibrant  business \necosystem in Singapore.\n\nThe  Asia-Pacific  is  one  of  the  fastest  growing  regions  in  the  world  and  this \ntrend  is  expected  to  continue.  By  offering  a  nimble  and  hospitable  business \nenvironment, Singapore remains a reliable launch-pad for companies seeking \nnew opportunities. Many American companies gain access into other Southeast \nAsian markets and expand their regional presence via their Singapore-based \noperations. I look forward to greater collaboration between Singapore and the \nAmerican business community.\n\nI would like to thank the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore for playing \na  pivotal  role  in  nurturing  strong  economic  relations  between  the  U.S.  and \nSingapore through its business insights, connections, and active engagement.

     'AMCHAM HISTORY \n\n1917 \xe2\x80\x94 2016\n\n1917 \xe2\x80\x94 A group of \n\nbusinessmen formed the American \nAssociation of Singapore. The \nAssociation served the interests of \nAmerican business well over the \nsubsequent 50 years, including two \nWorld Wars, until the late 1960s.\n\n1973 \xe2\x80\x94 The number of American companies in Singapore had increased significantly. ABC \n\nsurveyed 35 U.S. firms in Singapore, and it was decided that an independent organization, registered \n\nunder Singapore law, should be established. This took place after an option to formalize the ABC won 74% \n\nsupport. The first task of the ABC was to become recognized by the Singapore Government. In December, \n\nthe American Business Council was registered as a trade society and employers\xe2\x80\x99 group. Vic Buhler was \n\nnamed the first chairman of the proposed organization, to be called the American Business Council.\n\n1972 \xe2\x80\x94 By this time, \n\nSingapore, Malaysia, and \nIndonesia were the only \n\nAsia-Pacific countries without an \n\nAmerican Chamber of Commerce.\n\n1974 \xe2\x80\x94 ABC held its first Annual \n\nGeneral Meeting. George Hargens, Managing \n\nDirector, Amoco Petroleum Co, was elected \nChairman. At the end of its first year, ABC\xe2\x80\x99s \n\nmembership had grown from 150 to 226 \n\nmembers. ABC joined the U.S. Chamber of \n\nCommerce in 1974.\xc2\xa0\n\n2003 \xe2\x80\x94 Singapore and the United States signed the Free Trade Agreement (FTA). AmCham was a strong supporter of the U.S.-\n\nSingapore FTA and played a vital role during the negotiations, particularly by serving as a sounding board for policy input. This in turn \n\nled to a series of consultations with both the American and Singapore negotiators. With the implementation of this FTA on January 1, \n\n2004, this important trade relationship continues to expand and deepen. Doing business in Singapore became easier, faster, cheaper, \nand more transparent.  \n\nThe inaugural Corporate Community Day was held in 2003, with six leading companies and 450 volunteers participating. It has since \n\n \n\ngrown from strength to strength. Beneficiaries have included children\xe2\x80\x99s charities, the elderly, and needy families.  \n\n \n\nOn October 3, AmCham celebrated its 30th year anniversary, which became the highlight of the Singapore social calendar. The Shangri \n\nLa Ballroom was transformed into a streetscape of Singapore shophouses with scenes of everyday life from a bygone era.\n\n12\n\nBACK TO CONTENT PAGE\n\nMEMBERSHIP DIRECTORY 2017 | The American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore\x0c',
     '1969 \xe2\x80\x94 U.S. investments in Singapore had grown substantially.\xc2\xa0Oil exploration companies, heavy industrial manufacturers, and \n\nfinancial institutions made up the majority of American businesses in Singapore.\xc2\xa0Following the growth, it was determined that a separate \norganization was needed to serve the interests of American business. A group of American businessmen and representatives of the U.S. \nEmbassy met to discuss the best way to represent American business interests. An American Business Council (ABC) was formed under the \nauspices of the American Association, though functioning independently.\xc2\xa0ABC expanded its membership to include more American firms and \nelected its own chairman and secretary, but continued to meet informally. Members agreed the necessity and practicality of establishing a \nchamber of commerce or similar organization would be considered in the future.\n\n1972 \xe2\x80\x94 By this time, \n\nSingapore, Malaysia, and \nIndonesia were the only \n\nAsia-Pacific countries without an \n\nAmerican Chamber of Commerce.\n\n1971 \xe2\x80\x94 The ABC began recruiting speakers to \n\nlecture for the membership. The speakers\xe2\x80\x99 program, \n\nwhich continues today, addresses subjects of significance \nto the American business community. The ABC also began \n\ncompiling data on living costs and other information \n\nuseful to new American companies interested in \n\ninvesting in Singapore.\n\n1970 \xe2\x80\x94 The expanded \n\nABC first met on September \n\n24. The members agreed that \n\nin the future, the ABC would \n\nreview the necessity and \n\npracticality of establishing \n\na chamber of commerce or \nother similar organization.\n\n1983 \xe2\x80\x94 ABC decided that part of its responsibilities was to create and maintain a positive attitude among Singaporeans toward \n\nAmerican businesses operating in Singapore. The positive response led to the formation of the Cultural Affairs Program, which has \n\nwon the Friend of the Arts Award from the Ministry of Information and the Arts on numerous occasions. Another important function \nof the ABC was its participation in the annual Washington Doorknock. Still operating as an annual event, the Doorknock is a meeting \n\nof representatives from the Asia-Pacific Council of American Chambers of Commerce (APCAC) with Congress and key officials of the \n\nExecutive Branch. It calls upon government leaders to support policies that maximize U.S. economic and political presence in the \n\nregion.\n\n1992 \xe2\x80\x93 The Board of Governors \n\ndecided to seek the approval of the \n\nSingapore Government to change \n\nthe name of the American Business \n\nCouncil to a Chamber of Commerce. \n\nOn September 15, 1993, ABC officially \n\nbecame the American Chamber of \n\nCommerce in Singapore.\n\nBACK TO CONTENT PAGE\n\n13\n\nMEMBERSHIP DIRECTORY 2017 | The American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore\x0c',
     '2004 \xe2\x80\x94The AmCham-SMU Scholarship Fund was started when AmCham \n\nraised $400,000 from its members and donors to endow the AmCham-SMU \n\nScholarship Fund. The funds were contributed by over 60 different member \ncorporations and individuals held at the Ambassador\xe2\x80\x99s Gala Dinner in September 2004. \nThe major donors were American Home Assurance, Motorola, Pacific Architects and \n\nEngineers, Neptune Orient Lines, and Harrah\xe2\x80\x99s Entertainment. The Fund received three \n\nfor one matching funds from the Singapore Government, bringing the total of the \n\nendowment fund to $1.6 million. \n\n2011 \xe2\x80\x94 The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Travel \n\nCards (ABTC) Act of 2011 was passed by the U.S. Congress on November \n\n4, 2011.
