Data Structures

\

As we have seen in the previous lessons, Python supports the following data structures: 
lists

dictionaries

tuples

sets



When to use a dictionary :

 - When you need a logical association between a 
 key:value
 pair.\
 - When you need fast lookup for your data, based on a custom key.
 - When your data is being constantly modified. Remember, dictionaries are  mutable\cf0 
\

When to use the other types:
 \
 - Use 
 lists 
if you have a collection of data that does not need random access. Try to choose lists when you need a simple,  iterable  collection that is modified frequently.
 - Use a 
\b set 
if you need uniqueness for the elements. 
- Use 
tuples 
when your data cannot change. 

Sets are like lists, with the difference that its elements can't be repeated. Tuples are also like lists, but they can't be modified. Dictionaries are basically lists made up of keys each associated with a value.}
